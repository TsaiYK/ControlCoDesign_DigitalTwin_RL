# ControlCoDesign_DigitalTwin_RL
The codes and data were used for demonstrating the control co-design (CCD) method for digital twin-enabled systems with deep reinforcement learning and multi-generational design. The research will be shown in ASME IDETC/CIE 2025.
1. Demonstration on a numerical example:

   *RL_PPO_dysys_CCD.ipynb*: main python codes written in jupyter notebook.
   *CCD_Data2.csv* and *CCD_Data_value2.csv*: data for initializing the neural networks of policy and value function.
3. Demonstration on an active suspension system:
4. Codes and data for road conditions and speed profiles are provided here.
